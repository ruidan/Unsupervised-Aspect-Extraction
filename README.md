# Unsupervised Aspect Extraction
Codes and Dataset for ACL2017 paper ‘‘An unsupervised neural attention model for aspect extraction’’. [(pdf)](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P17/P17-1036.pdf)

## Data
You can find the pre-processed datasets and the pre-trained word embeddings in [[Download]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1L4LRi3BWoCqJt5h45J2GIAW9eP_zjiNc). The zip file should be decompressed and put in the main folder.

You can also download the original datasets of Restaurant domain and Beer domain in [[Download]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qzbTiJ2IL5ATZYNMp2DRkHvbFYsnOVAQ). For preprocessing, put the decompressed zip file in the main folder and run 
```
python3 word2vec.py
python3 preprocess.py
```
respectively in code/ . The preprocessed files and trained word embeddings for each domain will be saved in a folder preprocessed_data/.

## Train
Under code/ and type the following command for training:
```
KERAS_BACKEND=theano THEANO_FLAGS="device=gpu0,floatX=float32" python train.py \
--emb ../preprocessed_data/$domain/w2v_embedding \
--domain $domain \
-o output_dir \
```
where *$domain* in ['restaurant', 'beer'] is the corresponding domain, *--emb* is the path to the pre-trained word embeddings, *-o* is the path of the output directory. You can find more arguments/hyper-parameters defined in train.py with default values used in our experiments.

After training, two output files will be saved in code/output_dir/$domain/: 1) *aspect.log* contains extracted aspects with top 100 words for each of them. 2) *model_param* contains the saved model weights

## Evaluation
Under code/ and type the following command:
```
THEANO_FLAGS="device=gpu0,floatX=float32" python3 evaluation.py \
--domain $domain \
-o output_dir \
```
Note that you should keep the values of arguments for evaluation the same as those for training (except *--emb*, you don't need to specify it), as we need to first rebuild the network architecture and then load the saved model weights.

This will output a file *att_weights* that contains the attention weights on all test sentences in code/output_dir/$domain.

To assign each test sentence a gold aspect label, you need to first manually map each inferred aspect to a gold aspect label according to its top words, and then uncomment the bottom part in evaluation.py (line 136-144) for evaluaton using F scores.

One example of trained model for the restaurant domain has been put in pre_trained_model/restaurant/, and the corresponding aspect mapping has been provided in evaluation.py (line 136-139). You can uncomment line 28 in evaluation.py and run the above command to evaluate the trained model.
